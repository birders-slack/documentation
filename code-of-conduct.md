The Code of Conduct is a work in progress. In terms of general guidelines for activity on Slack, it will probably look at lot like [this one](https://github.com/randsleadershipslack/documents-and-resources/blob/master/code-of-conduct.md).

The high-level priorities are:
- Respect
- Inclusivity
- Non-commercialism (no selling stuff, except possibly in specific channels designated for that purpose)

We may also adopt some guidelines specifically related to the sharing of information about wild birds and their whereabouts.
