## [Join Here!](http://www.birders.info)

This is a community for the discussion of birding-related topics. It's an inclusive, respectful place to network and have fun. It's not affiliated with any organization, and it isn't selling anything. Its upkeep is a volunteer labor of love.

### What is Slack?

Slack is collaboration software produced by the company [Slack Technologies](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/115004071768-What-is-Slack-). Many of us have found it to be a great way to manage communication with teammates at work and in other settings. We use the free plan, which includes just about every feature we might want.

### How to join

Anyone can join, and it's free - simply follow the steps at [birders.info](http://www.birders.info).

### What to do when you join

These are all optional, but will probably help you make connections and find your way around faster!

1. Introduce yourself. This is what the #intros channel is for. Where are you from? What brought you here?

1. Update your profile. Add a photo, say where you live, plug your blog or Twitter. Whatever else you think people should know.

1. Explore the channels. There are channels organized around regions (e.g. #nyc, #los-angeles), birding events, and various other birding topics.

1. If there's no home for your favorite topic, create it! Anyone can create a channel. Feel free to announce your new channel in #general.

### How to get help

- In Slack, ask your question in the #help channel.
- If you can't get into Slack or prefer not to post there for whatever reason, you can email the administrators at birders.help@gmail.com.

### Who runs this thing?

This is all pretty low-maintenance, but to the extent that anyone runs it, that would be the administrators - currently:
